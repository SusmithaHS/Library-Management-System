# Library-Management-System

## Objective
Create a console based Java application to simulate a simple Library Management System that allows:
- Viewing available books
- Issuing books
- Returning books

## Tools Used
- Java (JDK)
- IntelliJ IDEA 

## Features
- Uses two core classes:
  - Book: contains book ID, title, and issue status.
  - User: contains user ID and name.
- Adds sample books and users at startup.
- Displays all books with status (Available / Issued).
- Allows issuing a book by ID (only if available).
- Allows returning a book by ID (only if previously issued).
- Input handled using Scanner.
- Prevents issuing already-issued books or returning invalid books.

## Output
- Sample (https://github.com/SusmithaHS/Library-Management-System/blob/main/day3.jpg)
